\small{I am a $5^{th}$ year Ph.D. Student at Rice University advised by Dr. Lydia Kavraki. I have passed my defense, and my degree will by confered in August. In 2017, I recieved a NASA Space Technology Research Fellowship (now called Space Technology Research Grant) to conduct research in formal methods and robotics. I have applied my research at NASA; collaborating with the Robotics and Intelligence for Human Spacecraft (RIHS) team at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (JSC) and with researchers at NASA Ames. I have also collaborated with researchers at other labs and universities throughout the world. I have experience leading two small projects of three or four researchers while mentoring a Ph.D. student at Rice University, including choosing high-level goals, assigning tasks, and scheduling subgoals to ensure our team meets deadlines.}
